Features

- **Realtime** game rooms accross the web
- Multiple rooms & gameplay support
- Highly customizable gameplay definitions to suit your needs
- No registration required for players

- And more !

For what games ?
----------------

With **Open-Party**, you should be able to play to an infinite number of games!

- *Even yours?!*

Basically, it's just a framework, and you'll have to program games that have not been developed yet.
But it's a lot more simple and user-friendly than basic IRC bots, don't be afraid :)
